python mini oop project
as someone how has worked with java (an oop language)
working with python was so much easier, and it's structure is
very simple to work with,and yes it will never be like the oop based languages,
but it did the job without the complications of any other oop language

as project wise :
I was inspired to recreate the wichy cloud kitchen
as it's avery creative small business located in alex , egypt
and I liked the idea of build your own food experience, so I tried to "reverse engineer"
the idea and put my own "touch" to it, they started with burger and pizza,
and I added a pasta station and an already made menu if you are not in the mood to build your own
